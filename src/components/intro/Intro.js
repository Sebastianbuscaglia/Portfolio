          <p>
            Competent Full-stack Developer with over a year of experience in building Web & Mobile applications.
            <br />
            My goal is to provide efficient and effective solutions, abiding by the following principles in my work:
            <br />
            - I focus on delivering solutions that cater to my client's needs and address their problems.
            <br />
            - I believe in keeping my clients engaged throughout the development process, ensuring they are fully informed and satisfied with the progress of their project.
            <br />
            Despite my relatively short tenure, I have demonstrated a fast acquisition of skills and the ability to deliver high-quality projects. I am excited by the opportunity to continue growing and tackling new challenges in the field of software development.
            <br />
            Currently, I am working as a Full-stack Developer at Magnetic Cash, where I have successfully completed over 10 projects that are operational in various companies across Latin America and Europe.
